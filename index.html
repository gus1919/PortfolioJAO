            <p>Greetings, my name is Justin Oeters, pronounced like eight-ers, 
              and I have been interested in programming and computers since my 
              first Apple IIe in the 80’s.  As a youth, in addition to computers, 
              I was also a member of the Boy Scouts of America and a member of 
              several sports teams.  I graduated high school fourth in my class 
              and have earned a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree as well 
              as attended one year of law school.  My education invoked my thirst 
              for knowledge and I strive to learn new things every day.</p>
              <br>
            <p>Regarding employment, I have had several jobs ranging from retail
               work to probation.  My longest career paths have been as a customer 
               service representative for Best Buy and currently, a Probation 
               Officer for Butler County.   Working for Best Buy, I learned about 
               working with people and overcoming adversity as well as best business 
               practices.  As a probation officer, I learned to supervise, distribute 
               tasks, and keep people motivated to stay on task.  Although my 
               employment has been rewarding, I am ready for greater challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My experiences have taught me to be a dedicated worker and to do more
               than produce a mediocre result.  I am always willing to learn new things 
               and devote extra time to making a product that is not just good, but 
               phenomenal.  As an employee of your  company, I would bring all my skills 
               and knowledge to make us as successful as possible and further my knowledge
               even if it is not necessary.  Please contact me using the methods listed 
                <a href="#contact"> below.</a></p>
