# PortfolioJAO
Personal Portfolio

In this project, we were to design our own website to highlight our project portfolio and our resume.  It is designed to highlight our strongest work and our 
process behind it.  Many student who have successful porfolios are successful in finding a career after boot camp.  This website contains my personal projects, 
an abbreviated resume, a section about me, and how to contact me.  The links will take you to their respective sections or will take you to either the project 
website or the source code for the project.

The Website will look like this:
